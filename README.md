This is all the code used to create my personal website, shane.mcguckian.dev

In this project I wanted to use a wide range of tools. I'm always learning to use new tools,
and I wanted to showcase a good number of those here. Currently, the site is using the following 
technology stack:
* React
* Flask
* PostgreSQL
* SQLAlchemy
* pytest
* AWS EC2
* AWS RDS
* Trello
* GitHub Issues

One of the things that really drew me to programming early on was the open source 
community. This spirit of collaboration is what makes Python so incredible I think. 
In an effort to contribute to this great community, I've open sourced everything I can. 
I hope you enjoy my site, and please borrow anything you like. Feel free to dig into
some of the projects I've been working on, and take a look at what I've been learning 
recently.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
